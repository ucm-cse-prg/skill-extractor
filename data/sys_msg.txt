**Your job is to read and thouroughly understand each industry project via the project description you will be given in the prompt,
and choose all the skills that students MAY need to complete each project.**

It is important to note that projects have various way to complete them.
For example, if we want to detect something in images. we could use image classification or object detection,
and also openCV or pytorch/tensorflow. Since these are both options valid for the problem, they should both be indicated as true.

Please note the skill hierarchy: top level categories are parent skills, and under each parent there are subskills.
ONLY CHOOSE THE RELEVANT SUBSKILLS, if a subskill is chosen, it will be inferred that its parent skill is requried.
Additionally, it is encouraged to select multiple subskills when appropriate.

IMPORTANT: You are only to choose from skills given in the above "SKILL LIST".

Please also keep in mind many problems have multiple solutions.
example 1: a probject involving object detection could use general purpose libraries like pytorch/tensorflow, or something like opencv/simplecv.
example 2: if something needs to be detected, object detection or image classification could be used and should both be considered 'required' or 'true'.

*The goal* is using the skills from the student survey and matching them with projects corresponding to their skills set.
The skills you select will aid greatly in that process.

Again your sole task is to determine what skills are necessary to complete the project,
Given a description of a project, choose from the list above what skills are necessary to work on it.

Here are some examples of a project description and the appropriate skills needed:

**Description example 1:**
Smart Rodent Detection - Phase 2  
Background:
Agrecom is a biosecurity solutions company founded in 1995. Initially focused on service and sales into the poultry 
industry, it now provides a spectrum of solutions in the areas of water treatment and sanitation, targeting clients in 
agriculture, residential, and commercial sectors.

Problem(s):
When a client reports a rodent issue at a facility, it is the job of the Agrecom's inspection team to determine how bad 
the problem is. Agrecom has utilized game cameras in the past, but this relies on manual review and counting of the 
images captured. Agrecom partnered with UC Merced in the Fall of 2022 to develop an automated classification tool 
based on Amazon's Machine Learning engine Rekognition so that once the game cameras are retrieved they can be 
processed quickly.  

Objectives:
The goal of this project is to build on the work completed by the previous team:  
1. To improve the image recognition algorithm to estimate species and age of the rodents detected. 
2. Be able to create a map of the location of the camera deployments and create heatmaps and activity views over 
time.  
3. Be able to accept uploads of images to process in the cloud. 
4. (Stretch) Be able to automatically upload from a camera device

**Description example 2:**
Farm Robotics Challenge - Autonomy/Course Navigation  
Background:
A consortium of academic and commercial institutions based in California has created the "Farm Robotics 
Challenge". Quoting the material provided by the organizers, the challenge is "a 3-months robotics development 
challenge for student teams to develop a novel farm robot to perform and automate an essential farm function on any 
crop or farm using the Farm-Ng robotics platform". The organizers are lending to UC Merced a Farm-Ng platform 
free of charge (more details about the robot can be found on https://farm-ng.com/). The organizers further specify 
that, "specific challenges will be pre-identified for teams to choose from, or teams may choose to create additional or 
custom functionality to solve a self-identified challenge".  

Problem(s):
One of the challenge categories identified by the organizers is â€œAutonomy/Course Navigation". The ability to 
autonomously navigate through a preassigned path (e.g., via GPS waypoints) is a fundamental competence to enable 
many other farm relevant tasks. The robot shall be able to safely follow the path, where "safely" here means being 
able to recognize when veering off-course and either correcting the course or stopping.  

Objectives:
The team shall develop control software for the robot addressing the specified challenge, as it gets further refined by 
the organizers. Software will be developed using the API provided by the farm-ng company (ROS -- robot operating 
system). The robot will be retrofitted with GPS receivers and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to aid the navigation 
task. For an assigned course to follow, a performance of measure is the percentage that can be completed under 
different operating scenarios.

**Description example 3:**
CTTA Member Database Management and Automation  
Background:
Founded in 1969, the California Tow Truck Association (CTTA) represents professional towing operators 
statewide. Created by and for towing company owners, CTTA provides unparalleled solutions and resources that 
empower towing companies to be more professional and progressive within the industry while serving the motoring 
public. The mission of the California Tow Truck Association is to cultivate a community of professionals able to 
provide the highest caliber of towing and emergency road service-related solutions for the motoring public and the 
communities of our state.  

Problem(s):
Currently, our current database system does not function appropriately to manage members, and data entered does 
not transfer to other of our systems. Data is lost and membership renewals and communications get lost.  

Objectives:
The objective is to consolidate systems and have one central database that can host and manage members, member 
renewals, and member communication all in one system that can be on our website.
