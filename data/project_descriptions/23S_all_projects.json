    "23S-1-Can Damage Detection by Vision": "Background  \nThroughout the yea r, Neil Jones Food Company  (NJFC ) plants produce a variety of California tomato and Pacific \nNorthwest fruit  products for industrial, foodservice and retail customers. Our Northwest Packing facility has been  \ncanning Pacific Northwest fruit and providing industrial juices, purees and blends since the 1970s. Our  TomaTek \nfacility, built from the ground up in the 1980s, quickly became a leader in aseptic technology  supplying fresh -pack \nCalifornia tomatoes in industrial sizes and convenient #10 equivalent pouches. San  Benito Foods has been a \npreeminent packer of fresh, vivid, vine -ripened California tomatoes for over  100 years. Located in Hollister California , \nour his toric 1915 cannery is the ultimate example of what it  looks like to produce a high-quality  product that will \nstand the test of time. Because freshness and  quality are our primary goals, we work long hours to ensure every \nproduct meets not only our strict  quality standards, but more importantly \u2013 yours.  \nThe customer list at the Neil Jones Food Company is diverse \u2013 from the finest independent restaurants  in the \ncountry, to children\u2019s lunch trays across the U.S. We also customize products for food  manufacturer s, chain \nrestaurants, healthcare facilities, juice manufacturers, and cruise lines around the  world. Whether you\u2019ve known it or \nnot, you\u2019ve probably enjoyed our fine products in your favorite  retail private label brands, or enjoyed them in fine \nrestaurants  throughout North America.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nDue to unpredictable and uncontrollable challenges, the can lid placement and sea ling process  creates a seal problem \nwith the cans. The cans are flipped after the top lid has been placed and the  rims rolled to seal the product in. \nSometime the lids are placed  so far off that there is a large offset  in the lid and the top of the can itse lf. This will cause \nthe product to run out after the cans are  flipped over and run along the can lines.  Secondly, if the seamer goes out of \ntune or is not properly set up , it will roll the lid and can lips  improperly and will cause the cans to be just sligh tly taller. \nThis extra height in the cans will cause  issues in the next processing equipment.  \nCurrently, we do not have any detection or rejection system to pick up these improperly process  cans and \nremove them from our processing lines.  \n \nObjectives  \nDevelop a (vision -based ) solution that will detect the dented cans, offset lids, and too tall cans and reject the cans  \nfrom the process lines.",

Our business is to teach \nComputer Science, and we are located at the heart of the Central Valley, in the bustling little town of Merced. A major \ncomponent of effective Computer Scien ce education is practical laboratory sessions, and we rely heavily on Teaching \nAssistants (TAs) to run those activities.  \nTAs are selected from the pool of graduate students in our department, but since there may often be more \ngraduate students than the num ber of TA positions available, this means that not every graduate student is guaranteed \na TA position. When this situation arises, it is necessary to allocate the TAs based on a strict set of rules that the \ndepartment has agreed upon, so that everyone is o nboard.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nThe department has developed a formula for determining TA eligibility and priority, based on several factors, \nincluding experience in TAing courses, evaluations, etc. Applying the formula by hand is an extremely cumbersome, \nand error pr one process, sometimes resulting in unfair allocations.  \nAutomating the process is essential, especially given the growth of the department, in terms of both faculty, as \nwell as graduate and undergraduate students.  \n \nObjectives  \nIf a team takes on this project, they are asked to develop a database -driven web appli cation that allows the user to see \nTA allocation history, current eligibility and priority scores for each graduate student and faculty member, as well as \nthe ability to create an allocation, based on faculty and student preferences.  \nThe application should  be accessible via a web interface, with data stored on some server (preferably some SQL  \nflavor). Since the data is sensitive, security would be of utmost importance.  \nThere is currently a prototype application already developed, which can be used as inspir ation for the project, but \nthe prototype lacks a lot of necessary features as it is just a proof -of-concept.  \nIf a team takes on this project, more specific details will be provided, especially around the allocation formula,  \nnecessary for computing eligibil ity and priority.",

Planning and advising on bicycle infrastructure and problems needs to be \nbacked by road user data, which this project is aimed at. It is a practical research project including research, building,  \nand test ing of a specialized bike counting sensor.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nIn December 2021 the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) officially adopted a complete streets \npolicy. This policy states that \u2018all transportation projects funded or overseen by Caltrans will provide comfortable, \nconvenient, and connected co mplete streets facilities for people walking, biking, and taking transit or passenger rail\u2019 \n(https://dot.ca.gov/ -/media/dot -media/programs/sustainability/documents/dp -37-complete -streets -a11y.pdf ). \nSimilarly, the Merced Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Commission has recently discussed a potential proliferation of \nelectric skateboards, scooters, and bicycle use. For city planners and contracted engineers to plan a complete street \ninfrastructure, data about frequency and classification of traffic is essential.  \nExisting solutions of vision -based traffic counters do not automatically classify e -scooters (only p edestrians and \nbicyclists). The alternative, manually working though visual data, is costly and inefficient, because of the labor is takes \nto classify. An automated vision -based traffic counter will help facilitate traffic planning by providing the necessa ry \nroad user classification.  \n \n \nObjectives  \nDevelop a working prototype for a vision -based traffic counter.  Write software that analyzes the visual data to \nautomatically count and classify road users (e -scooters, bicycles, and pedestrians).",

We supply over 40 percent of national markets with \ningredient tomato paste and diced tomatoes. We provide bulk -ingredient products to food manufacturers and pouch \nand can ingredient and finished produc ts to the food service and retail trade. We are actively involved in the global \ntomato industry and ongoing tomato research, and we have pioneered changes in production technology that have \nhelped increase efficiencies throughout the industry. Our sales of  tomato products are over $800 million annually. \nAnd we still haul our tomatoes from the fields \u2013 just as our owner began his journey in 1970.  Our mission is, and has \nalways been, to produce tomato products which consistently achieve the quality and servi ce expectations of our \ncustomers in a cost -effective, environmentally responsible manner.  \nWe have two processing plants near Los Banos, and a third in Williams, CA, in addition to a Tomato -Drying Yard \nin Newman and Greenhouse Operation near Tracy. In our p rocessing facilities we convert fresh, ripened tomatoes \ninto shelf -stable tomato ingredients such as paste and diced, packaged in Aseptic bags within 50-gallon  drums and \n300-gallon bins (wood / plastic / or metal). The largest secondary (outer) container i s the wood bin which collapses \ninto 6 subcomponents. This packaging configuration is environmentally friendly and cost effective as it is returned by \nthe customer and reused for 8 or more cycles. Customers return bin parts to us year -round and we operate t he bin \nsort and repair operations accordingly.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nMorning Star Bin Sort and Repair colleagues perform a visual / tactile inspection of millions of bin parts between our \n3 plants to grade parts based on whether they are good, repairable, or destroy / salvage. For repairable items they also \nidentify what needs to be done to remediate the part to ensure it becomes a good, usable part. We spend millions of \ndollars annually to replace the small fraction of bin parts that are graded as unusable. Making consistently good \ndecisions in the grading process can avoid unnecessarily discarding usable components, while ensuring that approved \nparts wi ll consistently perform their required duty cycle without failure and product loss. If an automated vision \nsystem could be used to make more consistent, good decisions in this grading process, the average life cycle of bin \nparts could be increased, which h as a significant economic and environmental benefit.  The system would need to be \ncapable of being successfully taught what constitutes good / repair / destroy components.  \nReasonable and prudent capital / equipment costs beyond the default project budget can be negotiated to \nenhance project success.  \n \nObjectives  \nThe primary success factor is whether the vision system can be successfully taught to disc ern mechanically usable \ncomponents from a diverse range of part appearances (older / newer components), with one or more part types (the \nsix sides are comprised of 4 different part types with a couple  of variations). The year -round nature of our bin sort \noperation would afford a motivated team the opportunity to tweak and optimize the algorithms to enhance \nperformance. In addition to the core functionality, some of the bonus features that would enhance value would \ninclude:  \n\u2022 A functional system that can opera te in-line with current sort processes and provide near -real time feedback and \nrecommendations on the grading status (and would make it easier to populate the \"teaching\" library).  \n\u2022 Identifying the defect mode and / or the required repair.  \n\u2022 Keeping trac k of a parts count of each status.  \n\u2022 Picture retention of parts processed for future review, particularly in cases where the algorithm disagrees with the \nsorting colleague (useful for training and gaining agreement / training on \"borderline\" parts).",

Adding and removing data points should be fairly easy from  an administrative  perspective.",
    "23S-2-Create an alert system that given the certain criteria (creek level, dam level) can create an electronic alarm when a": "threshold is breached to be communicated automatically using social media, text or email.  Users can then subscribe \nto these alerts.",
    "23S-3-(Stretch goal) Using GIS data, flood plain and maps, create a projection of impacts of levee riverbank or breaches": "using street data from around the county.",
    "23S-19-Cilantro Yield Estimation": "Background  \nSupHerb Farms  is a company located in Turl ock, CA; whose primary business is contracting culinary herb \nproduction, processing of those herbs, and sales of finished  products around the world.  The primary herbs produced \nby SupHerb Farms are Basil, Cilantro and Parsley.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nSupHerb Farms would like to be able to accurately determine harvestable pounds of herbs from each production field \nprior to harvest. Herb crops grow every day and maintaining a schedul e is difficult for SupHerb as we visually \nestimate fields and often make errors in our estimation. These errors either cause plant downtime due to lack of crop \nor they cause collisions in between different fields that produce more pounds than were estimat ed, these occurrences \ncause product quality issues and potentially plant equipment downtime because we try to push processing machinery \nabove its intended productivity.  \n \nObjectives  \nExperiment will be executed at the UC Merced Experimental Farm Greenhouse in collaboration with SupHerb \nFarms . The capstone software team's objective is to develop a vision / learning system to detect cilantro leaves, and \nestimate volu me of leaves in an area planted with cilantro, by taking images every day as the cilantro grows.  The \nweight is calculated after every mow. The first phase of this project is to utilize cameras to see if they can provide \naccurate measurements of the crop m ass of cilantro in the area that is photographed.  Herbs are grown primarily for \ntheir leaves and the focus of this work should be to identify the total pounds of plant material that would be harvested \nfrom the area but to also identify the weight of unusa ble stems and the weight of usable leaves.",
    "23S-20-Student Experience Navigation": "Background  \nStudents at universities must navigate multiple websites containing specific in formation about the overall student \nexperience. This piecemeal information gathering is time -consuming, disconnected from context, and fragmented \nunderstanding. Globidea  is an initiative of academics that are sharing the objective of making information e asier to \nfind and navigate.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nGathering specific information across distributed websites related to the phases in a student journey, and presenting \nthem formatted appropriately on a centralized website is a manual process that is very time consuming. The problem \nis that if information is modified in the original source, the centralized page remains outda ted. One way to help is to \ncreate a link aggregation page: in this case the students have to follow each link and dig to find relevant information in \nthere. The solution for editors would be to select specific information across these linked sources and curate them, \nwhile keeping them connected to and updated from the original source. In addition, editors should be able to tag \nspecific information on various pages as they were being developed so that it could automatically be brought to the \naggregated si te rather than requiring individuals to locate and then capture this information.  \n \nObjectives  \nThe goal is to have information related to 5 phases of the student experience be shown on a centralized site, \nconnected to the original content on the other site, always be up dated if changes occur, and then gather additional \nresources and information if new information is tagged on other sites related to a phase. Those phases are: Planning \nto Attend, Getting Started, Making Progress, Finishing Up, and Moving Forward.  \nSpecif ically, we would like a software that allows to copy snippets of information from different pages / sites, \npasting them into a curated web page, so that the pasted content links back to the original source. The system would \nalso check if content that was copied / linked into the curated page has changed, and would auto -update the curated \npage, and/or alert of the change. As a bonus, the software would allow the curator to edit the formatting of the \naggregated content.",
    "23S-21-Training Matr ix - Phase 2": "Background  \nBetts Company  is a sixth-generation family -owned manufacturer and supplier of springs and heavy -duty truck parts  \nlocated in Fresno, CA . In order to ensure a safe and productive work environment the company needs to ensure all \nemployees are properly trained for the tasks they are assigned.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nBetts Company would like to see a software solution created to collect, warehouse and perform data analytics for the \ntraining required thro ughout the organization.  Today the ability of the organization to understand the training of each \nindividual is difficult to manage. The information is collected , but it is difficult to sort out who is trained, what skill \nlevel they posse ss, and when training n eeds to reoccur.  \n \nObjectives  \nExpand the functionality of the Training Matrix program developed by UC Merced students during the 2022 school \nyear. How: Use the existing program platform as the starting point.  Ruby on Rails and SQL will be the primary tools. \nGoals: Impro ved user interface, UI functionality on mobile devices, Additional SQL tables, Report Generation \ncapabilities, Scheduling and Reminders, Security features (MS Single sign -on), Deployment to Share Point \nEnvironment.",
    "23S-22-Evaluation of Coordination Using VR Hand Controllers": "Background  \nValley Children's Hospital  (VCH) is a healt hcare institution located in the central valley of California. VCH \nprovides  excellent healthcare service to all the children in the central valley. This project will focus in the Neurological \nexamination using virtual reality.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nThere is a need for improving the accuracy of the neurological exam. In order to enhance virtual medicine se rvices  \n(telemedicine, remote services) this project will explore the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to track movement during  \nneurological examinations.  \n \nObjectives  \nTask: Analyze movements of the arm with hand controllers.   \nGoal : Obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inf orm our understanding of the arm movements - motion ( using the \nVR hand controller)."
