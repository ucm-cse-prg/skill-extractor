Omron is the leader in the field of industrial automation with \noperations in over 40 countries and 150 locations worldwide. Our company is unique in that it devel ops new \nelectronics, mechanics, and software for an exceptionally broad spectrum of robotics - including Selective Compliance \nArticulated Robot Arm  (SCARA ), articulated, parallel link, cobots, and autonomous mobile robots - for the global \nmarket . \n \nProblem(s)  \nORT  designs and manufactures, among other things, non -mobile Robots, or Robotic \u2018arms\u2019. They are configured to \nrun with a PC controller that can also drive cameras and part moving equipment such as part feeders and conveyor \nbelts. The software that configures and runs on the PC and robot is called ACE (Automation Control Environment).   \nThese robotic arms can be used to move pieces from one part line to a different place (pick and place). To enable \nseamless object detection and precise robot positioning, the ACE software relies on camera -to-robot calibration. This \nprocess involves converting camera coordinate positions into the robot's own X -Y-Z coordinate system.   \nACE software system has the ability to locate objects in the real world using either 2 D or 3D cameras. In some \ninstances, the camera can be mounted to a part of the Robot\u2019s arm.   \nACE requires the ability to obtain a robot  coordinate position from a position located in any newly obtained \nimage or point -cloud (Camera coordinate system). This ability is referred to as camera to robot calibration.  The \ncalibration procedure happens through a series of pictures from a given camera position and interactive robot arm tip \nreal world placements.  A real world \u201ccalibration object\u201d (3 D printed piece) is in some cases placed in the images them \nand is easily recognized by ACE. The user moves the robot to touch the tip of the object. There are slightly different \ncalibration methods in use currently depending on if the camera is arm mounted, etc.    \nCurrently, there are some shortcomings to the process.  Calibration may need to be redone several times until a \nreasonable accuracy is achieved.  The user input is critical,  and errors are easily introduced. A lot of positioning is \ninvolved,  and the right positions must be chosen.   \nA single robot to world 3D translation is generated from the procedure. The precision of a given translation \nconversion may be off by several mm . \n \nObjectives  \nWe would like to improve the accuracy of the robot positions estimated from the camera by replacing the calibration \nmethod that does the conversion and/or the process to obtain it.  \nThe UC Merced team is embarking on an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the field of robotics by enhancing \ncamera -to-robot calibration for Omron's Industrial Fixed Position Robots, powered by the cutting -edge ACE \nsoftware. We are seeking passionate and  innovative students to collaborate with us in developing groundbreaking \nalgorithms and C# .dll files that will redefine the precision of robot positions estimated from camera inputs.  \nBy joining our team, you will have the chance to explore advanced techniques for calibrating camera vision \ncoordinates to robot coordinates, working with both 2D and 3D images/point clouds. This is a unique opportunity to \ndive into the fascinating world of  robotics, combining computer vision and automation to create real -world impact.  \nThroughout this collaborative project, you will work closely with industry experts from the ACE team, gaining \ninvaluable insights into the state -of-the-art technologies used in industrial robotics.

One of these services is \ncrop health images. Previously, Gradient would provide crop health images to growers using drones. Unfortunately, a s \nthe number of acres Gradient covered grew, the expense in imaging increased exponentially as well. As a result, \nGradient moved to using satellite imagery to provide crop health images to growers. Even though the imaging cost \nwas reduced by switching to s atellite images, Gradient is looking to further reduce the cost by creating its own \nplatform to process and view images.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nCurrently, Gradient is hiring a third -party company, EOS, to download the dataset of the most recent publicly \navailable satellite imagery from Sentinel 2. EOS then uses a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file, containing latitude \nand longitude coordinates, su bmitted by Gradient to find the grower fields in the satellite imagery data. Afterwards, \nEOS processes the images using band wavelength manipulation to create the popular crop health monitoring \nalgorithms such as NDVI and NDRE.

These robots perform obstacle avoidance and intelligent \nmultirobot collision avoidance behaviors wh ile navigating on the map, by extensively sharing data among themselves.  \nTaxiline is a feature in these mobile robots\u2019 navigation framework and runs on each individual robot every cycle. \nThe primary function of this feature is to determine whether the robot needs to re -path plan around a stopped robot \nin its path. The feature e nsures that if the leading robot is obstructed by an obstacle, the following robot that shares a \nsimilar path does not attempt to replan their path around the leading robot.

    "23F-16-Deadlock Prevention/ Recovery for Mobile Robot Fleets": "Background  \nOmron Robotics and Safety Technologies , Inc. (ORT)  is an automation technology development company \nfocused on robotics design and manufacturing. Omron is the leader in the field of industrial automation with \n\noperations in over 40 countries and 150 locations worldwide. Our company is unique in that it develops new \nelectronics, mechanics, and software for an exceptionally broad spectrum of robotics - including Selective Compliance \nArticulated Robot Arm  (SCARA ), articulated, parallel link, cobots, and autonomous mobile robots - for the global \nmarket . \n \nProblem(s)  \nA deadlock in a fleet of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) refers to a situation where two or more robots are unable \nto move due to mutual blocking, which means each robot is blocking the path of another robot. This results in a state \nof the system where non e of the robots can move forward and continue their jobs, and the entire system is stuck in a \ndeadlock. When a deadlock happens in Omron AMRs, it requires manual intervention. This not only affects the \nproduction  cycle time and efficiency of the fleet, but it  also makes the \u201cintelligent\u201d robots look dumb.  \nDeadlock recovery is a mechanism used in robotics to resolve deadlocks by identifying them and taking \nappropriate actions, such as modifying the trajectories of one or more robots that are stuck in the deadlock.  \nDeadlock prevention is a mechanism where the deadlocks are predicted beforehand,  and the robots\u2019 trajectories \nare modified in such a way that the deadlocks don\u2019t happen in the first place. One other way to predict and prevent \ndeadlocks is to change the order of jobs that are picked by the robots.  \n \nObjectives  \nOmron team has already developed some algorithms to recover the robots out of a deadlock. But they don\u2019t work for \nall the scenarios. Deadlock prevention is even a tougher problem and there\u2019s no solution for it yet.  \nMachine Learning/Reinforcement learning is one option that Omron team is considering to recover the robots \nout of deadlocks.",
    "23F-17-Building a Database for Community and Mentors Engagement": "Background  \nINNOVIT  is the premier Italian Innovation and Culture Hub, promoted by Italy\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \nInternational Cooperation and coordinated by the Consulate General of Italy in San Francisco and the Embassy of \nItaly in Washington DC. Located in the h eart of San Francisco, INNOVIT embodies Italy\u2019s long -term commitment \nto technological innovation and to strengthening ties with the Bay Area and the US ecosystem.  Through acceleration \nprograms, strategic partnerships, and international initiatives, INNOVI T connects the vital resources of Silicon Valley \nwith the best opportunities offered by Italian businesses. We are the bridge that links Italian excellence in \nentrepreneurship, culture, research, and technology to the global future.  INNOVIT designs and de livers acceleration \nand innovation services for Italian companies, startups, universities, and scientific centers.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nThis project is focusing on designing and building the INNOVIT community database, with a specific focus on \nmentors and community. The Mentors database is critical to deliver startup acceleration programs, while the \nCommunity Database is critical for launc hing marketing and engagement activities.  Without a well-designed  database \nthe operational activities of a strategic project like INNOVIT cannot run properly as the program is scaling rapidly.  \nDuring the last 6 months  alone, more than 3.000 people have joined +40 events, while more than 60 startups have \nparticipated in 2 acceleration programs involving more than 100 mentors.  \nNegotiable constraints are related to INNOVIT team support, data entry, deadlines,  and project expansion to \nother areas like Visitors registrations, Sales and Booking systems.  \nNon-negotiable  constraints  are mostly centered around users\u2019  experience and key requirements.  \n \nObjectives  \nThe team is asked to perform interviews, requirements analysis, and implementation.  At the end of the semester,  we \nare expecting to have a fully implemented database with a user-friendly  UI.",
    "23F-18-CTTA Member Database Management and Automation": "Background  \nFounded in 1969, the California Tow Truck Association (CTTA)  represents professional towing operators \nstatewide. Created by and for towing company owners, CTTA provides unparalleled solutions and resources that \nempower towing companies to be more professional and progressive within the industry while serving the mo toring \npublic. The mission of the California Tow Truck Association is to cultivate a community of professionals able to \nprovide the highest caliber of towing and emergency road service -related solutions for the motoring public and the \ncommunities of our state.  \n \nProblem(s)  \nCurrently, our database system does not function appropriately to manage members, and the data  entered does not \ntransfer to our other systems. Data is lost and membership renewals and communications get lost.  \n \nObjectives  \nThe objective is to consolidate systems and have one central database that can host and manage members, member \nrenewals, and member communication all in one system that can be on our website. The task at hand is to develop \ntwo separate websites that will b e linked with one central database that has been built by last year\u2019s  capstone team."
