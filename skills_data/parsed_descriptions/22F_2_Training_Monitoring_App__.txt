The web app should provide a login interface for managers and new hire employees. Managers should be able to 
create (or import) a list of online classes that are internal to the STM department. The app should allow the set up of 
different departments or functions for different managers and employees to choose from. Managers should be able to 
choose 10 -20 courses from a set of ~200 to assign to new hires. Managers should be able to define the start and finish 
dates. Upon comp letion of the classes, the new hire employee should be able to demonstrate their completion of 
classes by answering questions or presenting their understanding to the manager. Once a new hire employee indicates completion of a course, the manager should be  able to confirm this after reviewing the answers or presentations. Each 
function and each department should be able to summarize the statistical data on employee completion dates from 
start to finish. The app should also be able to display an overview of how many managers are training how many 
employees and a chart of how  many trainees are in progress.
