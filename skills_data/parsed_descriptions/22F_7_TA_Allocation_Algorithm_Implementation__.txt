If a team takes on this project, they are asked to develop a database -driven web appli cation that allows the user to see 
TA allocation history, current eligibility and priority scores for each graduate student and faculty member, as well as 
the ability to create an allocation, based on faculty and student preferences.  
The application should  be accessible via a web interface, with data stored on some server (preferably some SQL  
flavor). Since the data is sensitive, security would be of utmost importance.  
There is currently a prototype application already developed, which can be used as inspir ation for the project, but 
the prototype lacks a lot of necessary features as it is just a proof -of-concept.  
If a team takes on this project, more specific details will be provided, especially around the allocation formula,  
necessary for computing eligibil ity and priority.
