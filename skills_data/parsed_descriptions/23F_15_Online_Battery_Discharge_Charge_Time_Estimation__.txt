Estimate the remaining discharge time/charge time based on current as well as from the previous data.  
• Multiple standard methods need to be identified both deterministic and probabilistic methods.  
• These methods should be evaluated to identify the best estimation method.  
• Limitations and assumptions associated with these methods should be established.
