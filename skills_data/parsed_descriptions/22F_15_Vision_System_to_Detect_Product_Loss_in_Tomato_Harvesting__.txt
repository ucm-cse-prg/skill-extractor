To improve harvester driversï¿½ abilities to meet these goals, CSGS woul d like to implement cameras connected to 
computers with object detection software on to the harvesters with the ability to identify tomatoes that have been left 
on the ground behind it. The AI vision system could provide real -time feedback to the harvester  drivers by identifying 
the product and classifying the condition it is in, such as its size, location on the bed, or relative intactness. All of 
these could help the driver to know when a problem is occurring and what corrective actions they should take. Along 
with feedback, the classifications could be stored, and reports generated to give insights to product loss, and compare 
the quality of harvesting between machines.
