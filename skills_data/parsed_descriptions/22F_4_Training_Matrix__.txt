We need a database (SQL) solution that can be housed on Microsoft Shar ePoint. The software needs a friendly user  
interface to allow HR to input new records. It also needs an interface for other designated users to retrieve operator  
training records. The software should be able to provide notification of employee training requirements. We should be  
able to analyze who is trained in a specific work center or what training is required for an operator to work in a work  
center.
