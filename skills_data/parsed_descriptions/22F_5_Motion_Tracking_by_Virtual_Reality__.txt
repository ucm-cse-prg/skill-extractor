The goal is to obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inform our understanding of the relationship between visual 
and motor processes during task performance.  The objective of this project is to create a VR environment to analyze 
elbow flexion and extension, and to extract the data regarding  eye-tracking and motion -capture. As a premium 
objective, the team will analyze the velocity and the coordination of that movement in VR.
