Objec tives of this project are as follows:  
• Taking in a list of technicians, their capabilities, and customers and their job requests, create a weekly /monthly 
work schedule that strictly follows biosecurity quarantine requirements.  
• Taking into account expected job duration , suggest route optimization for each technician maximizing their day.  
• Allow the addition of jobs to the schedule and suggest which technicians are quarantined enough to do the work, 
and what jobs could be impacted by it – shuffling the work and schedule as needed to fit it in.
