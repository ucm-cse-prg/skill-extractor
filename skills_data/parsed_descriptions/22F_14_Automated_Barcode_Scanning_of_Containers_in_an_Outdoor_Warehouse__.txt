As the forklift approaches a container to pick it up, or alter nately as is backs away from a container after it sets the  
container down, a camera could capture and accurately read the container ID and queue each ID for transaction to a  
location (section, row) specified by a forklift driver. There may be functionally equivalent alternatives to this process 
that the team can identify.  
The most critical technology to develop is a robust ability to capture and read the barcode labels under a variety 
of conditions. A user -friendly interface that is intuitive, robust, and e fficient would be important as well. Additional 
functionality to apply the core technology to additional use cases (shipping, etc.) would be a bonus, as would any work 
to pave the way for this functionality to be easily integrated with existing information  systems (e.g., make it easier to 
go from prototype to full implementation). One way to measure performance would be the expected ROI ... what 
would we expect the full implementation to cost, compared to the expected value of improved productivity and 
inventory accuracy.
