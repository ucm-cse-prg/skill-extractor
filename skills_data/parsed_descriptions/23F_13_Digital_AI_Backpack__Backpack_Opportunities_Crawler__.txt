Extract and store inside a structured database a set of opportunities for students (i.e., internships, jobs, gigs, 
scholarships, grants), including important metadata such as name, description, URL for applying, application deadline 
or deadlines, and impor tant dates. The algorithm should also create meta tags relevant to the opportunity, which can 
be later used by a recommender algorithm matching opportunities to specific students.  
This project is recommended for a student and/or group of students interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields 
such as Text Recognition, OCR, LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT).
