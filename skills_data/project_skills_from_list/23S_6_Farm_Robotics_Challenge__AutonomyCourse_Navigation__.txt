Project Description: The team shall develop control software for the robot addressing the specified challenge, as it gets further refined by  
the organizers. Software will be developed using the API provided by the f arm-ng company (ROS -- robot operating  
system). The robot will be retrofitted  with GPS receivers and Inertial Measurement Units ( IMUs ) to aid the navigation 
task. For an assigned course to  follow, a performance of measure is the percentage that can be completed under 
different operating scenarios.  

### Assistant: What skills do you think a team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Python: As the primary language for developing ROS packages, a team of developers should have proficient knowledge of Python programming. They should be able to write robust and efficient code using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV.
2. Machine Learning: Object detection and classification are crucial aspects of the project. Therefore, a team of developers should possess knowledge in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. They should be able to train and deploy models for object detection and classification tasks.
3. Computer Vision: With the integration of cameras and GPS receivers, computer vision skills are essential for processing visual data. A team of developers should have experience in OpenCV or SimpleCV for image processing, feature extraction, and object detection.
4. Data Management: With the vast amount of sensor data generated during the project, data management becomes critical. A team of developers should be proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Firebase.
5. Robotics: Although not a requirement, having knowledge of robotics concepts and hardware will be beneficial for the development process. Understanding the fundamentals of robot movement, sensor fusion, and control algorithms will help the team create more accurate and efficient software.
6. Web Development: Developing a web
