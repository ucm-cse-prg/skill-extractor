Project Description: The primary success factor is whether the vision system can be successfully taught to disc ern mechanically usable 
components from a diverse range of part appearances (older / newer components), with one or more part types (the 
six sides are comprised of 4 different part types with a couple  of variations). The year -round nature of our bin sort 
operation would afford a motivated team the opportunity to tweak and optimize the algorithms to enhance 
performance. In addition to the core functionality, some of the bonus features that would enhance value would 
include:  
• A functional system that can opera te in-line with current sort processes and provide near -real time feedback and 
recommendations on the grading status (and would make it easier to populate the "teaching" library).  
• Identifying the defect mode and / or the required repair.  
• Keeping trac k of a parts count of each status.  
• Picture retention of parts processed for future review, particularly in cases where the algorithm disagrees with the 
sorting colleague (useful for training and gaining agreement / training on "borderline" parts).  

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description, the skills required to complete this project are:

1. **Python**: As the primary language used for machine learning, data analysis, and automation, proficiency in Python is essential.
2. **Machine Learning**: The project involves developing a vision system that can learn to identify and classify different parts. Machine learning skills will be crucial in creating and fine-tuning algorithms for image classification, object detection, and regression analysis.
3. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library used for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition. Knowledge of OpenCV/SimpleCV will help in developing the vision system and implementing the algorithms for part recognition.
4. **NumPy**: NumPy is a library for efficient numerical computation in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which will be useful for data manipulation and processing in the project.
5. **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides efficient data structures and operations for working with structured data, which will be useful for organizing and analyzing the data collected from the vision system.
6. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. While not essential for the project, knowledge of Tkinter can be helpful in creating visualizations and interfaces for the
