Project Description: The primary deliverable will be the fully functioning web -based application. This includes:  
• User Interface (UI): A user -friendly, intuitive, and responsive web interface for employees, managers, and 
administrators.  
• Backend Server: A secure and efficient server setup to handle requests and provide services such as user 
management, progress tracking, and notification management.  
• Database: A well -structured database to store all relevant data.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for this project? Please rank them in order of importance.

Assistant: Based on the project description and the listed skills, here are the skills that I believe are most important for this project, ranked in order of importance:

1. **Python**: Given the focus on back-end development and data processing, Python is crucial for building the server and handling data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
2. **Machine Learning**: With the goal of providing personalized recommendations, machine learning is essential for developing the algorithms that power the application's functionality.
3. **Data Management**: An efficient and well-structured database is necessary to store and manage user data, progress tracking, and notification management. SQL and NoSQL databases are both relevant for this project.
4. **Web Development**: Building a responsive and user-friendly web interface requires expertise in front-end development frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, as well as HTML/CSS.
5. **Backend Development**: Building a secure and efficient backend server requires knowledge of languages like NodeJS, ExpressJS, Flask, or Django, as well as experience with API design and implementation.
6. **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch**: These deep learning frameworks are useful for developing custom image classification models and object detection algorithms. While not strictly necessary, having some experience
