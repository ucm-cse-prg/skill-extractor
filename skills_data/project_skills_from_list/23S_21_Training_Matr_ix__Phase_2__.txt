Project Description: Expand the functionality of the Training Matrix program developed by UC Merced students during the 2022 school 
year. How: Use the existing program platform as the starting point.  Ruby on Rails and SQL will be the primary tools. 
Goals: Impro ved user interface, UI functionality on mobile devices, Additional SQL tables, Report Generation 
capabilities, Scheduling and Reminders, Security features (MS Single sign -on), Deployment to Share Point 
Environment.  

### Assistant: Which skills are most important for this project?

1. **Python**: As the primary language used in the project, Python is crucial for developing the core functionalities of the Training Matrix program.
2. **SQL**: Being a database-driven application, SQL is essential for managing and querying data within the program.
3. **Ruby on Rails**: As the primary web framework used in the project, Ruby on Rails provides the necessary structure and functionality for building the web application.
4. **Frontend Development**: With a focus on improving the user interface and UI functionality on mobile devices, frontend development skills are vital for creating responsive and intuitive user experiences.
5. **Backend Development**: In addition to frontend development, backend development skills are important for building the server-side logic and integration with other systems, such as SharePoint.
6. **Machine Learning**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the project description, machine learning skills may be useful for enhancing the report generation capabilities and improving the overall performance of the system.
7. **Version Control**: Given the importance of tracking changes and collaborating on the project, version control skills using Git and GitHub are essential for managing the codebase and ensuring proper documentation.
