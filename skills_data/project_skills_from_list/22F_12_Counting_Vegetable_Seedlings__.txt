Project Description: Develop software that will work with a series of cameras that could accurately count the number of usable plants per  
order. There could be multiple orders in a greenhouse.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description and skillset, here are the top 3 skills that a team of developers must possess to complete this project:

1. **Python**: This is a fundamental language for data science and machine learning tasks, which are crucial for plant counting. Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-image can be used for image processing, feature extraction, and classification.
2. **Machine Learning**: Plant counting requires analyzing images of plants to detect and classify them. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize different types of plants based on their visual features, such as leaf shape, color, and size. TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras can be used for building and training these models.
3. **Computer Vision**: Computer vision techniques can be applied to analyze images of plants and detect their features. OpenCV is an excellent library for computer vision tasks, including image processing, object detection, and tracking. It provides various functions for image manipulation, feature extraction, and pattern recognition.
