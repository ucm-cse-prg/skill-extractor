### Assistant: Please select the skills that you think are necessary for this project based on the provided information.

1. Python: As the project description mentions building a GUI interface in Linux environment, Python is an essential skill for this project. Additionally, Python is widely used in machine learning and AI applications, making it a crucial skill for any developer working on this project.
2. OpenCV/SimpleCV: The project involves adjusting AI/ML models to fit specific needs, which may require image processing and computer vision tasks. OpenCV is a popular library for these tasks, so having knowledge of OpenCV or SimpleCV would be beneficial.
3. NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, and it's commonly used in machine learning and AI applications. Developers working on this project will likely need to perform numerical computations, so familiarity with NumPy is essential.
4. Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Since the project involves adjusting model parameters, developers will likely need to work with large datasets, making Pandas a valuable skill to have.
5. Tkinter: Tkinter is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). While the project doesn't explicitly mention building a GUI, having knowledge of Tkinter can still be helpful for creating a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to adjust model
