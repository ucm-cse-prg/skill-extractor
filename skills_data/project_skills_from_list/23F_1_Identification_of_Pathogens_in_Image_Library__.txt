Project Description: Use the pathogen images files and create an algorithm and a software program that can now be used to ID plant 
pathogens . 

### Assistant: Based on the project description provided, here are the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project:

1. **Python**: As the project requires working with images and developing an algorithm to identify plant pathogens, proficiency in Python is essential. Python provides numerous libraries for image processing, machine learning, and data analysis, which will be useful in this project.
2. **Machine Learning**: The project involves developing an algorithm to identify plant pathogens using image processing techniques. Machine learning algorithms can be used to train a model to classify images based on their features. Therefore, experience in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras is necessary.
3. **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides various functions for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition. Familiarity with OpenCV will help in preprocessing the images, extracting features, and developing the algorithm to identify plant pathogens.
4. **NumPy**: NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing and data analysis. It provides efficient data types and operations for large datasets, which will be useful in handling the vast amounts of image data involved in this project.
5. **Pandas**: Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for working with tabular data, which will be helpful in organizing and
