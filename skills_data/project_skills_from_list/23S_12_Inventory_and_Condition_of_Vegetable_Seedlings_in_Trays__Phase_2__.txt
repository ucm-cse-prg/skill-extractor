Project Description: Develop software that will work with a series of cameras that can accurately count the number of usable plants per 
order. There can be multiple orders in a greenhouse. The object ive of phase 2 is to:  
• Identify trays, and cells within trays . 
• Determine for each tray cell the status of the plant seedling (good, bad, multiple, no plant).  
• Prepare the user interface to view and the data.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for this project?

1. **Python**: As the primary language used in the project, Python is essential for developing the software. Knowledge of Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Tkinter will also be useful.
2. **Machine Learning**: Accurate plant counting requires training machine learning models to identify and classify plant seedlings. Familiarity with popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras will help in building and optimizing these models.
3. **Computer Vision**: Computer vision techniques will play a crucial role in identifying and tracking plant seedlings across multiple images. Proficiency in OpenCV or other computer vision libraries will enable the development of algorithms for plant detection, classification, and tracking.
4. **Data Management**: Managing and processing large datasets from multiple cameras requires knowledge of data structures, databases, and data manipulation techniques. Familiarity with SQL-based and NoSQL databases will be helpful in storing and retrieving data efficiently.
5. **Front-end Development**: Creating an intuitive user interface to visualize and interact with the data requires proficiency in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.
6. **Back-end Development**: Building a robust backend system to handle image processing, data storage,
