Project Description: Task: Analyze movements of the arm with hand controllers.   
Goal : Obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inf orm our understanding of the arm movements - motion ( using the 
VR hand controller).  
 

### Assistant: Based on the project description provided, the following are the essential skills required for the team of developers to possess in order to complete the project:

1. **Python**: Since the project involves working with VR hand controllers, Python is a crucial skill for this project. It provides a platform for implementing machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and visualization.
2. **Machine Learning**: The project involves analyzing movements of the arm with hand controllers, which requires the development of machine learning models to obtain precisely quantifiable data. Skills in machine learning will be essential for developing these models.
3. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library used for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition. SimpleCV is another library that provides an easy-to-use interface for computer vision tasks. These libraries will be useful for extracting features from video data captured by the VR hand controllers.
4. **NumPy**: NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides efficient data types and operations for handling large datasets, which will be necessary for processing the video data captured by the VR hand controllers.
5. **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides efficient data structures and functions for working with tabular data, which will be useful for preprocessing and analyzing the video data.
6. **Tkinter**:
