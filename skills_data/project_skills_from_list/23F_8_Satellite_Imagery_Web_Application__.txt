Project Description: Gradient Crop Yield Solutions is interested in creating a web platform that displays processed NDVI/NDRE images 
using Sentinel 2 images. Grower fields will be mapped using a list of coordinates stored as a KML file. The ideal 
design would be a web platform  that accepts a KML file and returns the most recent processed Sentinel 2 satellite 
image using the NDVI or NDRE algorithm. The web platform needs to have a front -end and back -end that interact 
with each other. The front -end should have an option to upload  KML files, while the back end will process the file to 
get the most recent Sentinel 2 image.  After processing, the front -end should render a map with the most recent 
satellite image overlayed on top of the map.  

### Assistant: Which skill set do you think the team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Python: Given that the project involves working with satellite imagery, Python's libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV are essential for data manipulation and image processing.
2. Machine Learning: The project requires developing an algorithm to process satellite images using NDVI/NDRE techniques, which falls under the purview of machine learning.
3. Front-end Development: The project involves creating a web platform with a user-friendly interface, therefore, proficiency in front-end development technologies such as HTML/CSS, React, Angular, or Vue is necessary.
4. Back-end Development: The project also requires back-end development expertise to handle the processing of KML files, interaction with APIs, and database management using SQL or NoSQL databases.
5. Data Management: Effective data management is crucial for the project, including storing and retrieving satellite imagery data, as well as managing the metadata associated with it. Familiarity with databases like MySQL or MongoDB can be beneficial.
6. Networking: As the project involves interacting with external APIs and handling large datasets, understanding networking concepts and protocols can help streamline the development process.
7. System Administration: Knowledge of system administration can be useful for deploying and maintaining the web platform on cloud platforms like Google Cloud
