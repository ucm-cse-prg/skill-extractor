Project Description: Objective is to design and function tool that can help the company to identify and delete, modify, fix this bad data, 
gaps in data, and eliminate a large amount as per user requirement. This will reduce manual work related to fixing this 
bad data.    
 
Standard features:  
• Ability to read various formats of data (xml, csv, pdf etc.;) and display in rows and columns.  
• Give the user the ability to define each row or column of data according to the user’s preference. And modify or 
display the data that is not according to the defined parameters. Preferably in GUI for a layman to use it.  
• Combine different sets of data of same format into one set and customize as per user requirements.  
• Ability to export into different formats as per user needs.  
 
Bonus features:  
• Identify duplicate data in different formats, errors such as wrong address format, punctuation , spellings, and 
address styles. Filter the data and display the rows and columns with these discrepancies.  
• Creating visuals from the data . 

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description, which skills do you think are most important for a team of developers to possess in order to successfully complete the project? Please rank them in order of importance.

1. Python: Given the project's reliance on data manipulation and analysis, proficiency in Python is crucial for handling and processing large datasets.
2. Data Management: SQL and NoSQL databases are essential for storing, organizing, and retrieving data. Understanding how to manage data effectively is critical for the project's success.
3. Machine Learning: The ability to identify and eliminate bad data, gaps in data, and duplicates requires some knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques.
4. Front-end Development: Creating a user-friendly GUI for data manipulation and visualization requires expertise in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. Back-end Development: Building a robust backend system to handle data storage, retrieval, and manipulation necessitates proficiency in back-end frameworks like ExpressJS, NodeJS, Flask, and Django.
6. Object Detection and Classification: Being able to identify and classify objects within images is useful for eliminating duplicates and improving data quality. Familiarity with libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow can be helpful here.
7. Large Language Models: Understanding how to utilize large language models for
