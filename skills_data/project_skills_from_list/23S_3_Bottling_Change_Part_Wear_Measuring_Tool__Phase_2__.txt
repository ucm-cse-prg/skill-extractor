Project Description: Design a tool that can be used to measure the pocket size in a variety of change parts. The goal is to have a tool that is 
operational with one hand, provid es repeatable measurements independent of the person using the tool, and measures 
down to a high precision . The tool  should be designed for 750ml and 1.5L bottles.  

### Assistant: Based on the project description and the list of skills provided, which skills are essential or highly desirable for a team of developers to possess to complete this project? Please rank them in order of importance.

1. Python - As the primary language for data analysis, machine learning, and automation, Python is crucial for developing the tool's measurement algorithm and interface.
2. OpenCV / SimpleCV - For image processing and computer vision tasks, such as measuring the pocket size, OpenCV is an essential skill to have. SimpleCV provides a simpler alternative for image manipulation and processing.
3. Machine Learning - To develop a tool that can provide repeatable measurements independent of the person using it, machine learning algorithms can be employed to account for individual variations in measurement results.
4. NumPy - As a library for efficient numerical computation, NumPy is useful for scientific computing and data analysis, which are crucial aspects of the project.
5. TensorFlow/Keras - These deep learning frameworks can be utilized for training machine learning models to perform accurate measurements.
6. C/C++ - For developing the tool's core functionality, such as image processing and measurement, proficiency in C/C++ is beneficial.
7. Java - For developing the tool's user interface and integrating it with other systems, Java is a valuable skill to have.
8. Data Management - SQL-based databases (e
