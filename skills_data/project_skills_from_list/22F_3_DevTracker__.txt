Project Description: The team is requested to develop a web application to enable gathering of data about the code check -in activities in 
SVN for each project and generate key performance indicator (KPI) reports for management to have a better 
understanding o f resource allocation.  
At the end of this project, WDC would like to see a workable web application that can get data from SVN and 
generate KPI reports. A responsive web user interface to provide users with the correct KPI result is expected.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for completing this project?

1. **Python**: Given the requirement to interact with SVN and generate KPI reports, Python is a crucial skill for this project. It provides an easy-to-use library called `svnclient` for working with Subversion repositories. Additionally, Python's popularity and versatility make it an ideal choice for data analysis and visualization tasks.
2. **Machine Learning**: While not directly related to SVN or KPI reporting, Machine Learning skills can be useful in analyzing and interpreting the gathered data. By applying ML algorithms to the collected data, the team can identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that might inform future development decisions.
3. **Data Analysis**: This project involves working with large datasets, so having experience in data analysis is essential. Skills in NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib will help the team process, manipulate, and visualize the data effectively.
4. **Web Development**: Creating a responsive web application requires knowledge of front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. Back-end skills in languages like Python, Node.js, or Ruby on Rails are also necessary for building the server-side logic and database integration.
5. **Version Control**: As the project involves managing code changes and collaborating with multiple developers,
