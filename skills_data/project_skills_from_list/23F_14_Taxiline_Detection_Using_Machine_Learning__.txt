Project Description: So given all the required data, the Taxiline algorithm essentially finds out whether the given robot is taxilining with the 
robot in the front and feeds  the result to the replanner. The existing algorithm, which is deterministic and rule -based, 
has many unaddressed edge cases. To  handle all the edge cases and to improve the accuracy, we are considering a 
machine learning based approach.   
 
Following is a real example:  In the above picture, the paths for 5 robots are shown: Robot R1 (pink), R2 (red), R3 
(yellow), R4 (green) and R5 (Orange). Ignore all other robots. R1 to R4, even though they are going to different final 
goals, since their paths are similar, they all just  queue up behind one another without trying to replan around. But if 
you look at R5, its original path (straight dotted orange line) is obstructed by R1 and it replans around R1 as R5 is not 
“Taxilining” with R1 i.e., R1’s path is not similar to R5’s.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think a team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Machine Learning: Since the project involves using machine learning algorithms to handle edge cases and improve accuracy, a team of developers should have expertise in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
2. Computer Vision: As the project requires analyzing images and detecting obstacles, knowledge of computer vision techniques and libraries like OpenCV or SimpleCV is essential.
3. Data Management: The project involves working with large datasets, so experience in data management tools like NumPy, Pandas, and SQL databases is crucial.
4. Software Development: Given the complexity of the project, a team of developers should be proficient in software development principles, including version control, testing, and debugging.
5. Front-end Development: The project will involve creating a user interface for the replanning system, so familiarity with front-end technologies like React, Angular, or Vue is important.
6. Back-end Development: A team of developers should also have experience in back-end development frameworks like ExpressJS, NodeJS, or Django, as well as API design and implementation.
7. Large Language Models: As the project involves training a large language model to understand the context of the robot's movement, knowledge of large language models like BERT or RoBERTa is beneficial.
