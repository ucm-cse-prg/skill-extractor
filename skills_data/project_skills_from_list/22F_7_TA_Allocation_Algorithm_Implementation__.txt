Project Description: If a team takes on this project, they are asked to develop a database -driven web appli cation that allows the user to see 
TA allocation history, current eligibility and priority scores for each graduate student and faculty member, as well as 
the ability to create an allocation, based on faculty and student preferences.  
The application should  be accessible via a web interface, with data stored on some server (preferably some SQL  
flavor). Since the data is sensitive, security would be of utmost importance.  
There is currently a prototype application already developed, which can be used as inspir ation for the project, but 
the prototype lacks a lot of necessary features as it is just a proof -of-concept.  
If a team takes on this project, more specific details will be provided, especially around the allocation formula,  
necessary for computing eligibil ity and priority.  

### Assistant: Please select 5 skills from the above list that you think would be most important for completing the project described. Provide a brief explanation for each skill selection.

1. **Python**: This is a fundamental language for data science and web development, making it a crucial skill for this project. Python will be used for creating the web application, handling data manipulation, and implementing machine learning algorithms.
2. **SQL**: As the data is stored in a database, SQL is essential for querying and managing data. The ability to write efficient and secure SQL queries will enable the team to retrieve and manipulate data effectively.
3. **Machine Learning**: Allocation is a complex process that involves predicting the best match between students and faculty members. Machine learning algorithms can help automate this process by analyzing historical data and providing predictions based on patterns found in the data.
4. **Large Language Models**: Large language models such as BERT or RoBERTa have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition. These models can be applied to analyze text data related to student and faculty profiles, allocations, and preferences.
5. **Front End Development**: A visually appealing and user-friendly web application is essential for effective collaboration and communication among stakeholders. Front-end development skills will allow the team to create a modern
