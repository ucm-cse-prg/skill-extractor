Project Description: Provide a better and efficient coaching and observation tracker webpage to eliminate the need for manually tracking 
follow -ups. This will be relevant to the new coaching process. This will give ability for the company to sustain the new 
coaching process an d utilize it to make LMS proficient and promote a productive work environment.  
 
Standard Features:   
• Different display pages based on type of coaching (skill and behavioral).  
• Drop down option for task type, date user, observer. Check marks for list of skills to select.  
• Date drop down for follow -up date.  
• Display interactive KTS (training documentation) with check marks.  
• As each check mark gets selected, it gets quantified (score) based on skills, behavior, and safety.  
• Option to attach any documents.  
• Ability to link original (parent) observation if this is a follow -up using observation ID no.  • Once it is linked, the page should show the history from the previous one.  
Bonus Features:  
• Provide analytics on based KTS score, performance correlation.  
• Show trends from previous parent observations along the follow -up ones.  
• SMS or email as reminder of the follow -up. 

### Assistant: Based on the project description and the list of skills provided, which skills does a team of developers must possess to complete the project? Please rank them in order of importance.

Assistant: Thank you for providing the project description and the list of skills. Based on the requirements mentioned in the project description, here are the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project:

1. Python: Since the project involves developing a web application, Python is the primary language that the team must have expertise in. They should be able to handle various tasks such as data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and web development.
2. Front-end Development: The project requires creating interactive interfaces for observers and coaches. Therefore, knowledge of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is crucial.
3. Back-end Development: The backend of the application needs to be developed using a server-side scripting language like Python. The team should also have experience in working with databases, APIs, and server configuration.
4. Machine Learning: The project involves analyzing and predicting training documentation scores. Therefore, some knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be helpful. However, it's not a must-have skill.
5. Data Management: The application needs to handle large amounts of data, so the team should have experience in managing and processing data using libraries like NumPy, P
