Project Description: First experiment will be executed at the UC Merced Experimental Farm Greenhouse in collaboration with SupHerb 
Farms:  the capstone software team's objective i s to develop a vision/learning system to detect basil leaves and 
estimate volume of leaves in an area planted with basil, by taking images every day as the basil grows. The weight is 
calculated by the Farm Manager after every mow.  
This phase of the project  is to utilize cameras to see if they can provide accurate measurements of the crop mass 
of basil in the area that is photographed. Herbs are grown primarily for their leaves and the focus of this work should 
be to identify the total pounds of plant materi al that would be harvested from the area but to also identify the weight 
of unusable stems and the weight of usable leaves. It should be understood that we try to harvest stems not longer 
than 15 inches; if a plant were to have two stems and the longest is  22 inches and the shorter stem is 17 inches, the 
22-inch stem will have the top 15 inches cut off and the shorter stem will be cut off at the same so only 10 inches 
would be harvested.  Basil is normally harvested 4 times in Central California with the fi rst harvest starting when the 
total length of average stems are 20 inches from the ground to the tip, thus leaving 5 inches of stubble from which the 
next cutting grows.  On the next cut we would let the basil reach 21 inches of length and cut 6 inches fro m the 
ground, so we do not harvest the woody stubble. The 3rd and 4th cuts continue up 1 inch each.
