Project Description: If a team takes on this project, they are asked to develop a database -driven web appli cation that allows the user to see 
TA allocation history, current eligibility and priority scores for each graduate student and faculty member, as well as 
the ability to create an allocation, based on faculty and student preferences.  
The application should  be accessible via a web interface, with data stored on some server (preferably some SQL  
flavor). Since the data is sensitive, security would be of utmost importance.  
There is currently a prototype application already developed, which can be used as inspir ation for the project, but 
the prototype lacks a lot of necessary features as it is just a proof -of-concept.  
If a team takes on this project, more specific details will be provided, especially around the allocation formula,  
necessary for computing eligibil ity and priority.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think a team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Python: The project requires knowledge of Python programming language, as it will be used for both front-end and back-end development.
2. Web Development: A team should have experience in developing web applications using frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.
3. Back-end Development: Knowledge of server-side scripting languages like NodeJS, ExpressJS, Flask, or Django is crucial for creating the server that will handle requests and responses.
4. Database Management: Understanding how to design, implement, and manage databases using SQL or NoSQL databases is essential for storing and retrieving data.
5. Front-end Development: Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required for building the user interface and ensuring a smooth user experience.
6. Machine Learning: Familiarity with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch can help with automating the allocation process.
7. Data Analysis: Being able to analyze and interpret data is important for understanding the eligibility and priority scores of graduate students and faculty members.
8. Collaboration: As the project involves multiple stakeholders, effective collaboration tools like Git and GitHub can help manage the development process.
9. Security: With sensitive data involved, the team should have knowledge of security best practices and techn
