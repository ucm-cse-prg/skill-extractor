Project Description: Build an app that enables entering availabilities and relevanc es of groups and  see in real time the variations for group  
scheduling to inform the optimal final schedule.  
Organizer:  
• Define time slots on a calendar (matrix of slots) for one or more meetings . 
• List of participants: to one meeting, or to groups and respective meeting s. 
• For each participant in a group/meeting, express a "relevance value" for that group/meeting . 
• For each participant also express the requirement: in person, virtual, or either . 
• Define whether the participants shall start as totally available (participa nts have to turn off unavailable slots) or  
unavailable (participants turn on available slots) . 
• View whether participants responded or not . 
• View the result for each time slot, the weighted group availability (number + color) . 
• View real time changes with variations of availabilities and relevances.  
Participants:  
• See the respective matrix with the following starting options in all time slots: black (not considered for meeting) – 
green  (available) - red (unavailable) . 
• Can change each slot, expressing the " availability value" ( e.g., in the range red=0.0  to green=10.0) . 
• Can modify the availability of each slot or groups of slots viewing the matrix change in real time (number - color).  
• "Commit" their availability when ready.  
Requirements - in order of impor tance:  
• Find a color palette that provides a good user experience to represent availability, relevance, and the resulting  
relevance weighted group availabilities . 
• The change in availability (participant) or relevance (organizer) must change the colors/values of the respective 
slots in  the matrix in *real time* . • Deployment on a web server, so that the choices and user experience of the organizer and multiple parti cipants 
are visible in real time.  
• Organizer can add participants – groups . 
• Participants can change and recommit their availability . 
• Integration of the above features with other common calendar features . 

### Assistant: Please select the necessary skills for this project based on the provided requirements.

1. **Python**: As the project requires building a web application using Python, it is essential for the development team to have proficiency in this language.
2. **Django**: Since the project requires a web application, Django is a crucial skill for the development team. It is a popular Python framework used for building web applications.
3. **JavaScript**: Although the project does not require front-end development, having knowledge of JavaScript will be helpful for integrating the application with other calendar features.
4. **MERN**: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is a stack commonly used for building web applications. Having knowledge of this stack will help the development team to build and deploy the application efficiently.
5. **React**: React is a popular front-end library used for building user interfaces. Knowledge of React will help the development team to create an intuitive and responsive user interface for the application.
6. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python module used for creating graphical user interfaces. While the project does not require extensive graphics design, having some knowledge of Tkinter can help the development team to create a simple and basic UI.
7. **SQL**: Since the project involves managing data related to participants' availability and relevance, having
