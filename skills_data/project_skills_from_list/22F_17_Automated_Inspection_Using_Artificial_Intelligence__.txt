Project Description: Evaluate examples of visual defects per predefined inspection criteria using a machine learning algorithm/artificial 
intelligence that re duces inspection time and increases inspection accuracy. This will be achieved using a stationary 
camera & the camera's UI to capture images of defects on robotic parts of various sizes. Students are expected to 
develop an application utilizing ML algorith m/AI to ensure that defects are correctly identified under standard work 
cell lighting conditions.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think the team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. **Python**: The project requires knowledge of Python programming language for developing the machine learning algorithm/artificial intelligence.
2. **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch**: Familiarity with any of these deep learning frameworks is necessary for implementing and training the machine learning model.
3. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: These computer vision libraries are useful for image processing and feature extraction, which are crucial steps in the project.
4. **NumPy/Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis are essential tasks in machine learning, and NumPy and Pandas provide efficient data structures and functions for these purposes.
5. **React Native/Swift/Flutter/Ionic**: For building the mobile application that will display the captured images and provide input for the machine learning model, proficiency in at least one of these cross-platform app development frameworks is required.
6. **HTML/CSS**: Knowledge of web development technologies can be helpful for creating a web interface for displaying the results of the machine learning model.
7. **Backend frameworks (ExpressJS/NodeJS, Flask, ASP.NET, Django, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails)**: Experience with backend development frameworks can help create a robust back-end system for storing and processing the data used by the
