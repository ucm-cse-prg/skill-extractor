Project Description: To improve harvester drivers� abilities to meet these goals, CSGS woul d like to implement cameras connected to 
computers with object detection software on to the harvesters with the ability to identify tomatoes that have been left 
on the ground behind it. The AI vision system could provide real -time feedback to the harvester  drivers by identifying 
the product and classifying the condition it is in, such as its size, location on the bed, or relative intactness. All of 
these could help the driver to know when a problem is occurring and what corrective actions they should take. Along 
with feedback, the classifications could be stored, and reports generated to give insights to product loss, and compare 
the quality of harvesting between machines.  

### Assistant: Please select at least 5 skills from the above list that you think are essential for completing this project. Justify your choices.

1. Machine Learning: This project requires training an AI model to detect objects, classify them, and provide real-time feedback to the driver. Machine learning is essential for this task as it enables the development of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions.
2. Computer Vision: The project involves using cameras to capture images of the tomato bed and detecting objects within those images. Computer vision is crucial for this task as it allows developers to extract useful information from visual data.
3. Python: Python is a popular language used in machine learning and computer vision projects. It provides a vast range of libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas, which are necessary for image processing and analysis.
4. TensorFlow/Keras: These are popular deep learning frameworks that can be used to develop and train AI models for object detection and classification tasks. They offer pre-built tools and functionality that simplify the process of building and deploying machine learning models.
5. Data Management: Collecting and storing data related to the tomato bed and its conditions is crucial for generating insights into product loss and comparing the quality of harvesting between machines. Data management skills are necessary to design and implement databases and data pipelines that can handle large amounts of data.
