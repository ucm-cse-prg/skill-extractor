Project Description: The objective is to consolidate systems and have one central database that can host and manage members, member  
renewals, and member communication all in one system that can be on our website.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided information, here are the skills that a team of developers should possess to complete the project:

1. **Python**: As the primary language for machine learning and data analysis, a team should have proficiency in Python to build the core logic of the system.
2. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks, OpenCV or SimpleCV is essential. Developers should be able to manipulate images and extract relevant information.
3. **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is crucial for building a centralized database that can automatically categorize and predict member behavior. Developers should have experience with popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
4. **Large Language Models**: Large language models like BERT or RoBERTa can help improve the accuracy of member classification and communication. Developers should be familiar with these models and their implementation.
5. **APIs**: To integrate the system with other services and databases, developers should know how to design and implement APIs using frameworks like ExpressJS or Flask.
6. **Cloud Platforms**: Given the scope of the project, it's likely that the system will be deployed on a cloud platform like Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS. Developers should have experience working with these platforms and their respective services.
7. **Data Management**: With a focus on managing member
