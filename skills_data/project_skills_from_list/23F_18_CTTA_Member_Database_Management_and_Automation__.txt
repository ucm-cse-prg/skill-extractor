Project Description: The objective is to consolidate systems and have one central database that can host and manage members, member 
renewals, and member communication all in one system that can be on our website. The task at hand is to develop 
two separate websites that will b e linked with one central database that has been built by last year’s  capstone team.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description and skill set, here are some of the key skills that a team of developers should possess to complete the project:

1. **Python**: As the central database is being developed using Python, a team of developers should have proficient knowledge of this language to create the backend architecture and interact with the database.
2. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: For developing the frontend of the website, OpenCV or SimpleCV can be used for image processing tasks such as face detection, object detection, and image classification.
3. **NumPy/Pandas**: These libraries provide efficient data manipulation and analysis capabilities, which are essential for handling large datasets in the project.
4. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Developers should have knowledge of Tkinter to design the user interface of the website.
5. **C/C++**: While C and C++ are not explicitly mentioned in the project description, they may be required for developing certain components of the project, such as the backend server or machine learning models.
6. **Machine Learning**: The project involves image classification, object detection, and other machine learning tasks. Therefore, developers should have experience in implementing machine learning algorithms using popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
7. **Large Language Models**
