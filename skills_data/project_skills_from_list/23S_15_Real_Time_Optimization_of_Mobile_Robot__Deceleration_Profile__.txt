Project Description: The aim of this project is to train a neural network that will dictate the deceleration of a robot to execute smooth and 
precise stopping.  We do not know the weight loaded on the robot nor the floor conditions, as some floors might be 
slippery. The system will change commanded deceleration value based on a difference between commanded and 
executed deceleration in the previous cycle. We assum e that at any time, we know the perfect distance between a 
robot and a goal, and we can also measure executed deceleration perfectly. Students will use the reinforcement 
learning approach to train the network and overcome combined issues that stem from noi se in the system, not 
knowing the mass of the payload and surface quality of the floor.  

### Assistant: Of course! Here are the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described:

1. **Python**: As the primary language for machine learning and reinforcement learning, Python is essential for developing the neural network and training it.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: To train the neural network using reinforcement learning, the team must have experience with implementing RL algorithms and optimizing them for real-time applications.
3. **Neural Networks**: Understanding how to design and implement neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is crucial for this project.
4. **OpenCV** or **SimpleCV**: Computer vision libraries like OpenCV or SimpleCV are necessary for processing visual data from cameras and detecting obstacles.
5. **Microcontrollers**: Familiarity with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi or Arduino is helpful for integrating the trained model into the robotic system.
6. **Algorithms and Data Structures**: A solid understanding of algorithms and data structures is required to efficiently process and analyze the data from the sensors and cameras.
7. **Networking**: Knowledge of networking protocols and technologies, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, is important for integrating the robotic system with other devices and systems.
