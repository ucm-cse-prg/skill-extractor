Project Description: The goal is to obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inform our understanding of the relationship between visual 
and motor processes during task performance.  The objective of this project is to create a VR environment to analyze 
elbow flexion and extension, and to extract the data regarding  eye-tracking and motion -capture. As a premium 
objective, the team will analyze the velocity and the coordination of that movement in VR.  

### Assistant: Which skills are essential for completing the project?

1. Machine Learning: To develop and train algorithms to analyze the relationship between visual and motor processes during task performance.
2. Computer Vision: To design and implement a system for eye-tracking and motion capture in VR.
3. Data Science: To collect, process, and interpret the data obtained from the experiment.
4. Web Development: To build a web interface for users to access and view the data collected.
5. Software Engineering: To design and implement the VR environment and the software components required for the experiment.
6. Programming Languages: Proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and C++ is necessary for developing the various components of the project.
7. Frameworks: Familiarity with frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue is important for building the web interface and front-end components.
8. APIs: Understanding how to use APIs to integrate the different components of the project is crucial.
9. Version Control: Knowledge of version control systems like Git and GitHub is necessary for managing the codebase and collaborating with team members.
