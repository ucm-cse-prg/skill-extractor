Project Description: Omron team has already developed some algorithms to recover the robots out of a deadlock. But they don’t work for 
all the scenarios. Deadlock prevention is even a tougher problem and there’s no solution for it yet.  
Machine Learning/Reinforcement learning is one option that Omron team is considering to recover the robots 
out of deadlocks.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided information, here are the top 5 skills that a team of developers should possess to complete the project successfully:

1. **Machine Learning**: Given the project's focus on developing algorithms to prevent deadlocks using machine learning, a strong understanding of this field is essential. The team should have experience in implementing machine learning models, such as reinforcement learning, to solve complex problems like deadlock prevention.
2. **Python**: Python is a popular language used in machine learning and data science, making it an essential skill for the team. They should be proficient in writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code in Python to develop and train machine learning models.
3. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library that can be used to analyze images and detect objects. SimpleCV is another image processing library that can be used for similar tasks. Both libraries are important for developing algorithms that can identify objects and prevent deadlocks.
4. **C/C++**: C and C++ are low-level programming languages that are commonly used for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other low-level system software. Knowledge of these languages can help the team understand how the robot's hardware works and develop more efficient algorithms for preventing deadlocks.
5. **Data Management**: Effective data management is crucial when working with large datasets, which is
