Project Description: The objective of the project is to develop an APP to streamline the capstone purchasing process to get timely 
approval from the faculty and reduce the staff time. Complete capstone purchasing process involves:  
1) Purchase request submission, approval, budget tracking, maintaining inventory of purchases.  
2) Placing the order using CBS2/Oracle system.  
3) Getting tracking/delivery updates to the Campus  
4) Delivering the items to various teams  
 
Minimum viable product should include the following items:  
1) Submission of purchase requests by capstone teams to the teaching faculty: SoE Staff will provide a sample 
purchase request form along with data verification criteria for various fields. Once the form is submitted by a 
Team, teaching faculty should be noti fied of the submission.  
2) Tracking team budget/expenses for faculty to consider during the approval: Team’s expenses should be tracked 
against the allotted budget for each team. This information should be available to the teaching faculty with each 
purchase request submission.  
3) Review and approval of the purchase requests by teaching faculty: Reminders should be sent to the faculty until 
the approval process has been completed. If the request has been rejected, the reason for the rejection should be 
communicated back to the team along with suggestions from the faculty.  
4) Submission of the approved purchase requests to SoE Instructional Staff: If the request has been approved, the 
approved purchase request form should be submitted to SoE staff for processing.  
5) A running inventory of all the approved items should be available for SoE staff and teaching faculty to keep track 
of purchases and flag items for retrieval at the end of the semester.  
 Add-ons: 
1) Placing the order using CBS2/Oracle system: This will require communication between APP and Oracle API 
(involves campus level permissions).  
2) Getting tracking/delivery updates to the Campus: This will require getting relevant information using Oracle API 
based on the Purchase Order number.  
3) Delivering the items to various teams: This will require identifying the delivery boxes by scanning labels. Once the 
team is identified, a custom message is sent to the team regarding the delivery place and time.  
4) Making instructional equipment requests: The App should provide a way for student teams to make equipment 
requests to the Instructional Team. The request should first be approved by the instructor before being routed to 
the Instructional team (email will b e provided).  
5) Making lab access requests: The App should provide a way for student teams to make lab space requests to 
Instructional Team. The request should first be approved by the instructor before being routed to the 
Instructional team (email will be provided).  
6) Safety training report: The App should allow the instructor to upload student roster along with team information 
(team numbers, team members, roles). Each student should be able to upload their safety certificates to the app. 
The App should be able to gene rate a report indicating which students have completed the training and which are 
still pending .
