Project Description: Mobile app for tracking valve on and off times and calculating durations. Integrat e with a map  interface so you can 
see which irrigation checks are currently on/off and then be able to select the  check to see historical irrigation activity . 

### Assistant: Which skills should the team of developers possess to complete this project? Please rank them in order of importance.

1. Python - The app will likely be built using Python, and it's a necessary skill for any developer working on a project like this.
2. OpenCV / SimpleCV - Image processing is an important aspect of the project, and OpenCV/SimpleCV are essential tools for this task.
3. Machine Learning - The app needs to be able to classify and predict irrigation activities, so knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques is crucial.
4. TensorFlow/Keras - These are popular deep learning frameworks that can help with image classification and prediction tasks.
5. NumPy/Pandas - These libraries provide efficient data manipulation and analysis capabilities, which are useful for preprocessing and analyzing irrigation data.
6. C/C++ - While not strictly necessary, having some knowledge of C/C++ can be helpful for developing the app's core functionality and integrating with other systems.
7. Java - Knowledge of Java can be beneficial for developing Android apps, but it's less relevant for this particular project.
8. Web Dev - Depending on how the app is designed, web development skills may be useful for creating a web interface or integrating with external services.
9. Front-end - Similarly, front-end skills can be helpful for creating a user-
