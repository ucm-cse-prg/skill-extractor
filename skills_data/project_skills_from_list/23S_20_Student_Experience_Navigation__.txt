Project Description: The goal is to have information related to 5 phases of the student experience be shown on a centralized site, 
connected to the original content on the other site, always be up dated if changes occur, and then gather additional 
resources and information if new information is tagged on other sites related to a phase. Those phases are: Planning 
to Attend, Getting Started, Making Progress, Finishing Up, and Moving Forward.  
Specif ically, we would like a software that allows to copy snippets of information from different pages / sites, 
pasting them into a curated web page, so that the pasted content links back to the original source. The system would 
also check if content that was copied / linked into the curated page has changed, and would auto -update the curated 
page, and/or alert of the change. As a bonus, the software would allow the curator to edit the formatting of the 
aggregated content.  

### Assistant: Which skill sets do you think the team should prioritize for this project?

1. **Python**: Given the project's reliance on web scraping and data aggregation, Python's extensive library support for these tasks makes it an essential skill for the team.
2. **HTML/CSS**: Front-end development skills will be crucial for creating a user-friendly interface and integrating the aggregated content.
3. **JavaScript**: Given the need to automate updates and notify the curator of changes, JavaScript's ability to interact with web pages and manipulate their content will be valuable.
4. **Databases**: To manage and store the aggregated content, the team should have knowledge of database systems such as SQL or NoSQL.
5. **Version Control**: With multiple developers working on the project, version control systems like Git will help track changes and maintain code integrity.
6. **Cloud Platforms**: Depending on the chosen cloud platform, the team may need to have experience in deploying and managing applications on platforms like Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS.
7. **Algorithms and Data Structures**: To efficiently handle large amounts of data and perform complex operations, the team should have a good understanding of algorithms and data structures.
8. **Networking**: As the system will likely involve communication between different websites, the team should have some networking expertise
