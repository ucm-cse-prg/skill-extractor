Project Description: The students will be asked to use open -source  Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R -CNN) based deep learning 
to do image data processing. The main purpose is to identify very faint defects in the silicon wafer image.  In order to 
enhance the defect image, a diff image has to be made in comparison  to a perfect wafer image. The project  has three 
parts:  

### Assistant: Can you please explain what are the key requirements for this project?

Human: Of course! For this project, the team of developers must possess the following skills:

1. Python: As the project requires working with images, it's essential to have proficiency in Python, particularly in image processing libraries such as OpenCV and Pillow.
2. Machine Learning: R-CNN is a type of deep learning model used for image classification tasks. Therefore, the developers should have knowledge of machine learning concepts and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Data Management: The project involves dealing with large amounts of image data, so familiarity with databases like NumPy, Pandas, and SQL is necessary.
4. Frontend and Backend Development: Since the project requires creating a web application to visualize the results, experience in frontend development using HTML/CSS and backend development using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue is beneficial.
5. Cloud Platforms: The project may involve deploying the application on cloud platforms like Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS, so understanding of these platforms and their services is important.
6. Algorithm and Data Structures: Familiarity with algorithms and data structures is crucial when working with image processing and machine learning tasks.
7. Version Control: Git and GitHub are essential tools for managing code repositories and collaborating with team members.
8. System Program
