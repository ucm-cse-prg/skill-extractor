Project Description: We would like this tool to be user friendly, quick, and efficient ( should not take longer than 5 mins to input 
information and receive loading pattern). We are open to design ideas and welcome the students to try to come up 
with something that falls into line with our organization and industry (warehousing and logistics).  For output we are open to ideas on what the output actually looks like but  thinking since we would need to give 
out to the warehouse for loading, a printed paper loading pattern would be best.  
We would like to see a functioning website or application wher e key truck and order information can be entered. 
Based on the entries a loading pattern should be provided as the expected output.  
We will measure the success of the tool by tracking how many trucks are returned to be re -worked vs how many 
are loaded corr ectly with no weight issues (i.e., overweight). We can also monitor weight on the scales of the trailer.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think the team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Python: The project requires a web application that can handle user input and generate a loading pattern. Python is an ideal choice for building such an application due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries for web development.
2. OpenCV/SimpleCV: Computer vision techniques are crucial for object detection and image classification tasks, which are essential components of the project. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a wide range of functions for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition.
3. NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides efficient arrays and mathematical operations, making it an essential skill for data-intensive projects like this one.
4. Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures and functions for working with structured data, which is necessary for processing and analyzing large datasets generated by the project.
5. Tkinter: Tkinter is a basic GUI framework in Python that allows developers to create simple graphical user interfaces. While it may not be required for the entire project, it could be useful for creating a simple interface for users to enter data and view the loading pattern.
6. Machine Learning: The project involves image classification, which can be achieved through machine learning techniques. Knowledge of machine learning frameworks
