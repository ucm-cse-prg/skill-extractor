Project Description: Request to write a code in C# that tracks the Bluetooth asset tag (AoA  – Angle of Arrival -- Beacon/moving device) 
from an A oA Gateway (Locator/receiver/fixed position)  to a grid measured by feet (See reference “Hardware labels”  
and “4x4 Grid”  in https://ucmerced.box.com/s/44n679xfchxbb27aqsj151z1jukmc5af ). The dimensions of the grid 
can be of any length, as long as they are uniform.  
Position readings would come from an A oA Beacon to the A oA Locator, to which the data will be extracted and 
passed on to a PC (Windows 10/11 OS). The data extraction can be in string or int datatypes.  
Devices are from Dusun, which has open -source code samples that includes API that can be used for this project.  

### Assistant: Please provide the necessary skills required for this project.

1. **C#**: As the project requires writing code in C#, proficiency in this language is essential.
2. **.NET Framework**: Since the project involves working with Windows operating systems, knowledge of the.NET Framework is crucial.
3. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Understanding how BLE works and being able to implement it in C# is important for tracking the Bluetooth asset tag's location.
4. **Angular of Arrival (AoA)**: Familiarity with the concept of AoA and its application in Bluetooth tracking is necessary for developing the code.
5. **4x4 Grid**: Knowledge of grids with dimensions measured in feet is necessary for accurately calculating the Bluetooth asset tag's location.
6. **Data Extraction**: Being able to extract data from the AoA readings and pass it on to a PC is essential for the project.
7. **API Integration**: Integrating the Dusun devices' API into the C# code is necessary for reading the Bluetooth asset tag's location.
8. **String or Int Data Types**: Proficiency in working with either string or int data types is necessary for storing and processing the extracted data.
9. **Windows Operating System**: As the
