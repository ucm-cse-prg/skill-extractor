Project Description: Request to write a code in C# that tracks the Bluetooth asset tag ( AoA – Angle of Arrival -- Beacon/moving device) 
from an A oA Gateway (Locator/receiver/fixed position)  to a grid measured by feet (See reference “Hardware labels”  
and “4x4 Grid”  in https://ucmerced.box.com/s/44n679xfchxbb27aqsj151z1jukmc5af ). The dimensions of the grid 
can be of any length, as long as they are uniform.  
Position readings would come from an A oA Beacon to the A oA Locator, to which the data will be extracted and 
passed on to a PC (Windows 10/11 OS). The data extraction can be in string or int datat ypes.  
Devices are from Dusun, which has open -source code samples that includes API that can be used for this project.  

### Assistant: Please provide the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described above.

Here are the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described above:

1. **C#**: The project requires the development of a Windows application using C#, so proficiency in this language is essential.
2. **ASP.NET**: The project involves creating a web service that receives data from the AoA Locator and sends it to a PC for analysis, so knowledge of ASP.NET is necessary.
3. **SQL**: The project involves working with a SQL database to store and retrieve data, so familiarity with SQL is important.
4. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: The project involves tracking the Bluetooth asset tag using BLE technology, so experience with BLE protocol and programming is required.
5. **Cross-platform development**: Since the project involves developing a Windows application that communicates with a web service, knowledge of cross-platform development technologies such as React Native, Flutter, or Ionic is beneficial.
6. **Machine Learning (ML)**: The project involves analyzing the data received from the AoA Locator to determine the location of the asset tag, so understanding of ML concepts and experience with ML libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is helpful.
7. **Game Development**: The
