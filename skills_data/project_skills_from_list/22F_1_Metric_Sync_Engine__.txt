Project Description: Team will develop a software library that will allow an engineer to buffer time series metric API requests when an 
internet connection is lost. Engineers must be able to allow for custom callbacks that can occur before and/or after 
data is sent or if data must be modified in some way before sending. The sync engine will be tested against a server 
providing metric data to the team's application. Once internet connection is re -established, the goal will be to send 
these buffered metric elements to the SweepAP I and confirm that the buffered data is uploaded and that the local 
copy of the data is removed upon confirmation. Engineers must be able to install these packages through NPM 
package manager and/or PIP.  
Extended goal if time permits would be to provide a  one-page dashboard that provides simple metrics about 
current size of the REST API metric buffer, past buffering activity. (i.e., is the buffer currently in use, how many 
successful sent buffer events have occurred in the last day, average event downtime,  any reported errors sending 
buffers).
