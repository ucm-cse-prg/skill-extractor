Project Description: Experiment will be executed at the UC Merced Experimental Farm Greenhouse in collaboration with SupHerb 
Farms . The capstone software team's objective is to develop a vision / learning system to detect cilantro leaves, and 
estimate volu me of leaves in an area planted with cilantro, by taking images every day as the cilantro grows.  The weight is calculated after every mow. The first phase of this project is to utilize cameras to see if they can provide 
accurate measurements of the crop m ass of cilantro in the area that is photographed.  Herbs are grown primarily for 
their leaves and the focus of this work should be to identify the total pounds of plant material that would be harvested 
from the area but to also identify the weight of unusa ble stems and the weight of usable leaves.  

### Assistant: Of course! Here are the skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described:

1. Computer Vision: The project involves developing a vision/learning system to detect cilantro leaves and estimate volume of leaves in an area planted with cilantro. Therefore, the team must have expertise in computer vision techniques such as object detection, image segmentation, and image processing.
2. Machine Learning: The system must be able to learn and improve over time, so knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning is essential.
3. Data Management: The project requires collecting and processing large amounts of data, including images, which means the team must have experience in managing and analyzing data using tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and SQL databases.
4. Web Development: The system must be accessible through a web interface, so knowledge of web development frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue is necessary.
5. APIs: The system must interact with external APIs, such as those provided by Google Maps, to obtain information about the location and conditions of the experiment. Therefore, experience in creating and consuming RESTful APIs is important.
6. Cloud Platforms: The system must be deployed on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud, to ensure scalability and reliability. Familiarity with cloud computing concepts
