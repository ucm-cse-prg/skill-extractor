Project Description: We need a database (SQL) solution that can be housed on Microsoft Shar ePoint. The software needs a friendly user  
interface to allow HR to input new records. It also needs an interface for other designated users to retrieve operator  
training records. The software should be able to provide notification of employee training requirements. We should be  
able to analyze who is trained in a specific work center or what training is required for an operator to work in a work  
center.  

### Assistant: Based on the project description and the provided list of skills, I would recommend the following skills for the development team to possess:

1. **Python**: As the project requires a SQL database solution, Python's extensive libraries for database interactions, such as SQLAlchemy and pandas, will be essential. Additionally, Python's simplicity and readability make it a great choice for developing a user-friendly interface.
2. **SQL**: Given the project's focus on database management, proficiency in SQL is crucial. The team should have experience in writing efficient queries, creating indexes, and optimizing database performance.
3. **JavaScript**: For building a user-friendly interface, JavaScript is a vital skill. Front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue can help create responsive and interactive interfaces.
4. **HTML/CSS**: These are fundamental web development technologies that every developer should know. They enable the creation of visually appealing and well-structured websites.
5. **Back-end development**: To manage the database and provide a restful API, back-end development skills with languages like Node.js, Express.js, Flask, or Django are necessary.
6. **Machine learning**: While not explicitly mentioned in the project description, machine learning can be useful for analyzing employee training records and identifying potential training gaps. Knowledge of libraries like Tensor
