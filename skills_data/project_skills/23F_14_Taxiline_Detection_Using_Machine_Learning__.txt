### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listSo given all the required data, the Taxiline algorithm essentially finds out whether the given robot is taxilining with the 
robot in the front and feeds  the result to the replanner. The existing algorithm, which is deterministic and rule -based, 
has many unaddressed edge cases. To  handle all the edge cases and to improve the accuracy, we are considering a 
machine learning based approach.   
 
Following is a real example:  In the above picture, the paths for 5 robots are shown: Robot R1 (pink), R2 (red), R3 
(yellow), R4 (green) and R5 (Orange). Ignore all other robots. R1 to R4, even though they are going to different final 
goals, since their paths are similar, they all just  queue up behind one another without trying to replan around. But if 
you look at R5, its original path (straight dotted orange line) is obstructed by R1 and it replans around R1 as R5 is not 
“Taxilining” with R1 i.e., R1’s path is not similar to R5’s.  ### Assistant: Okay, I understand.
