### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listBuild an app similar to When2Meet, but with the following  differences.  
- Participants can express an "availability value" for each time slot.  
- Organizer: can express a "relevance value" of each participant.  
- The calendar displays the weighted availability of each time slot. The team will be provided the formulas, an d 
options to select values and visualize the results in a time slot.  ### Assistant: Sure! Here are the programming knowledge requirements to complete this project:  
1. Familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript for building the frontend and backend of the application.
