### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listThe web app should provide a login interface for managers and new hire employees. Managers should be able to 
create (or import) a list of online classes that are internal to the STM department. The app should allow the set up of 
different departments or functions for different managers and employees to choose from. Managers should be able to 
choose 10 -20 courses from a set of ~200 to assign to new hires. Managers should be able to define the start and finish 
dates. Upon comp letion of the classes, the new hire employee should be able to demonstrate their completion of 
classes by answering questions or presenting their understanding to the manager. Once a new hire employee indicates completion of a course, the manager should be  able to confirm this after reviewing the answers or presentations. Each 
function and each department should be able to summarize the statistical data on employee completion dates from 
start to finish. The app should also be able to display an overview of how many managers are training how many 
employees and a chart of how  many trainees are in progress.  ### Assistant: Thank you for providing the project description! Based on the requirements listed, here are the programming knowledge areas that may be necessary for completing the project:

1. **JavaScript**: Since the web app will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, proficiency in this language is essential. You'll need to know how to write clean, modular, and well-structured code, as well as handle events, validate user input, and manipulate the DOM.
2. **HTML/CSS**: A solid understanding of HTML and CSS is crucial for building a responsive and visually appealing web application. You should know how to structure your code using semantic HTML elements, create custom CSS styles, and implement CSS layouts.
3. **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-built components and CSS styles for quickly building responsive web applications. Familiarity with Bootstrap can help streamline your development process and ensure consistency in design.
4. **Node.js**: Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. If you want to create a backend API for handling requests and responses between the client-side and server-side, you'll need to learn Node.js.
5. **Express.js**: Express.js is a popular Node.js framework that simplifies the process of creating web applications. It provides middleware functions, templates, and other tools to help you build a robust and scalable backend API.
6. **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows you to store and retrieve data in a flexible and efficient manner. Knowledge of MongoDB can help you manage user accounts, track progress, and provide insights into employee completion rates.
7. **Passport.js**: Passport.js is a strategic framework for authentication in Node.js applications. It helps you handle authentication sessions, password hashing, and other security-related tasks.
8. **Socket.io**: Socket.io is a library that enables real-time communication between clients and servers. If you want to create a live update system that notifies managers and employees of changes in the training program, you'll need to understand how to use Socket.io.
9. **Javascript frameworks**: There are several JavaScript frameworks available, such as React,
