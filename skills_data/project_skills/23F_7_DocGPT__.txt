### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listDevelop a JSON schema that summarizes the contents of the PDF  using a large language model. For example, if 
presented with a table on a page, attempt to transform that table into a JSON formatted table object. JSON Schema 
can be predefined by the team. This includes defining what summary questions will need to be as ked to complete an 
analysis of a PDF . Software workflow must be able to process at least 10 PDF s per minute. Must be able to query 
compiled PDF  JSON data through a REST API. You’re  able to use either a locally hosted large language model or an 
online API to generate the machine -readable JSON data.  ### Assistant: To complete this project, you will need to have knowledge in the following areas of programming:  1. **JSON**: You will need to be familiar with the structure and syntax of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), including how to create and manipulate JSON objects, arrays, and schemas.  2. **Large Language Models**: You will need to understand how to use large language models, such as BERT or RoBERTa, to extract information from unstructured text. This may involve fine-tuning the model on a specific task, such as summarizing a PDF, or using pre-trained models to perform the task.  3. **REST APIs**: You will need to know how to build and use RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) to interact with the compiled JSON data. This may involve creating endpoints for retrieving and manipulating data, as well as handling HTTP requests and responses.  4. **Software Development**: You will need to have experience with software development tools and practices, such as version control (e.g., Git), debugging, testing, and code review.  5. **Programming Languages**: You will need to be proficient in at least one programming language, such as Python, Java, or JavaScript, to implement the project requirements.  6. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: You will need to have a solid understanding of data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal) to efficiently process and analyze the PDFs.  7. **Machine Learning**: While not strictly necessary, having some knowledge of machine learning concepts and techniques, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, can be helpful when working with large language models.
