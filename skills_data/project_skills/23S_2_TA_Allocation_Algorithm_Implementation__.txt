### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listIf a team takes on this project, they are asked to develop a database -driven web appli cation that allows the user to see 
TA allocation history, current eligibility and priority scores for each graduate student and faculty member, as well as 
the ability to create an allocation, based on faculty and student preferences.  
The application should  be accessible via a web interface, with data stored on some server (preferably some SQL  
flavor). Since the data is sensitive, security would be of utmost importance.  
There is currently a prototype application already developed, which can be used as inspir ation for the project, but 
the prototype lacks a lot of necessary features as it is just a proof -of-concept.  
If a team takes on this project, more specific details will be provided, especially around the allocation formula,  
necessary for computing eligibil ity and priority.  ### Assistant: Given the project description, here are the programming knowledge areas that may be useful or necessary for completing the project as a numbered list: 1. Database management systems (DBMS): Developing a database-driven web application requires proficiency in managing databases using SQL or NoSQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. 2. Web development frameworks: Knowledge of popular web development frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc. is essential for creating a responsive and user-friendly web interface. 3. Front-end development: Understanding how to build visually appealing and responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js is crucial. 4. Back-end development: Proficiency in server-side scripting languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, etc., and familiarity with popular back-end frameworks like Node.js, Express.js, Laravel, Django, etc. are necessary for building the server-side logic and API endpoints. 5. Security: With sensitive data involved, it's important to have knowledge of web application security best practices, including authentication and authorization, input validation, SSL/TLS encryption, and vulnerability assessment. 6. Data modeling: Understanding how to design and implement a data model that represents the structure and relationships of the data in the database is vital for developing an effective and efficient application. 7. User experience (UX) design: Creating a user-friendly application requires knowledge of UX principles, including user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. 8. Version control systems: Familiarity with version control tools like Git, SVN, or Mercurial is helpful for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and maintaining a record of the application's development history. 9. Testing and debugging: Knowledge of testing methodologies and tools, such as unit testing, integration testing, and debugging techniques, is essential for ensuring the application works correctly and is free of errors.
