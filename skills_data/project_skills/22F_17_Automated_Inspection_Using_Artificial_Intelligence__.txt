### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listEvaluate examples of visual defects per predefined inspection criteria using a machine learning algorithm/artificial 
intelligence that re duces inspection time and increases inspection accuracy. This will be achieved using a stationary 
camera & the camera's UI to capture images of defects on robotic parts of various sizes. Students are expected to 
develop an application utilizing ML algorith m/AI to ensure that defects are correctly identified under standard work 
cell lighting conditions.  ### Assistant: Sure! Based on the project description provided, here are the necessary programming knowledge areas for completing the project: 1.
