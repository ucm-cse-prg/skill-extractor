### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listWe need a database (SQL) solution that can be housed on Microsoft Shar ePoint. The software needs a friendly user  
interface to allow HR to input new records. It also needs an interface for other designated users to retrieve operator  
training records. The software should be able to provide notification of employee training requirements. We should be  
able to analyze who is trained in a specific work center or what training is required for an operator to work in a work  
center.  ### Assistant: Based on the provided project description, here are the necessary programming knowledge and skills to complete the project: 1. SQL programming: To create a database solution that can be housed on Microsoft SharePoint, you will need to have knowledge of SQL programming language. This includes understanding how to design and implement databases, write queries, and perform data manipulation and analysis. 2. Front-end development: The software needs a friendly user interface to allow HR to input new records and designated users to retrieve operator training records. You will need to have knowledge of front-end development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. 3. Back-end development: The software should be able to provide notification of employee training requirements and allow for analysis of who is trained in a specific work center or what training is required for an operator to work in a work center. You will need to have knowledge of back-end development technologies such as.NET, ASP.NET, C#, and VB.NET. 4. SharePoint integration: Since the software will be housed on Microsoft SharePoint, you will need to have knowledge of SharePoint's API and how to integrate with SharePoint sites. 5. User experience (UX) design: The software needs to have a user-friendly interface to ensure that HR and designated users can easily use the system. Knowledge of UX design principles and practices will be helpful in creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 6. Data analytics: The software should be able to provide notification of employee training requirements and allow for analysis of who is trained in a specific work center or what training is required for an operator to work in a work center. Knowledge of data analytics tools and techniques, such as Excel, Power BI, or Tableau, will be helpful in analyzing and visualizing data.
