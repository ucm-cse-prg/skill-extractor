### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listThe objective is to consolidate systems and have one central database that can host and manage members, member 
renewals, and member communication all in one system that can be on our website. The task at hand is to develop 
two separate websites that will b e linked with one central database that has been built by last year’s  capstone team.  ### Assistant: To complete this project, you will need the following programming knowledge:1. Database Management Systems (DBMS): You will need to know how to design, implement, and manage a database system that can store and retrieve data efficiently. Familiarity with popular DBMS such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL is essential.2. Front-end Web Development: You will need to create user interfaces for both websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. Knowledge of responsive design and UI/UX principles is also important.3. Back-end Web Development: You will need to develop the server-side logic and API endpoints for both websites using languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Java. Understanding RESTful architecture and how to work with APIs is crucial.4. SQL and NoSQL Databases: You should be familiar with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including their strengths and weaknesses, and when to use each.5. API Design and Implementation: You will need to design and implement APIs that allow data exchange between the two websites and the central database. Knowledge of RESTful architecture, JSON, and XML is helpful.6. Security: You should be aware of common web security threats and how to protect your applications from them, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and authentication vulnerabilities.7. Version Control Systems: You will need to use Git or another version control system to manage code changes and collaborate with team members.8. Testing and Debugging: You should be able to write unit tests and integration tests to ensure that your code works correctly and debug any issues that arise.9. Agile Methodologies: Familiarity with agile development methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban can help you manage your time and resources effectively during the project.10. Project Management: You should be able to break down the project into smaller tasks, set deadlines, and track progress to ensure that everything is completed on time and within budget.By possessing these skills, you will be well-equipped to handle the challenges of this project and deliver a high-quality solution that meets the requirements of the stakeholders.
