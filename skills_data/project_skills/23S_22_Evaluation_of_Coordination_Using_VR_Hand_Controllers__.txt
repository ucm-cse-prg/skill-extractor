1. Experience with Python programming language.  
2. Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas libraries for data analysis.  
3. Understanding of basic concepts in computer vision such as image processing, object detection, and tracking.  
4. Knowledge of machine learning algorithms and their applications.  
5. Familiarity with VR development frameworks such as Unity or Unreal Engine.  
6. Experience with sensor integration and data acquisition from sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.  
7. Understanding of signal processing techniques for filtering and feature extraction.  
8. Familiarity with plotting and visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
9. Knowledge of statistics and statistical modeling techniques.  
10. Experience with debugging and troubleshooting issues in code.
