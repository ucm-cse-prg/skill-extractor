### Human: given this project description, describe what programming knowledge is necessary to complete it as a numbered listExpand the functionality of the Training Matrix program developed by UC Merced students during the 2022 school 
year. How: Use the existing program platform as the starting point.  Ruby on Rails and SQL will be the primary tools. 
Goals: Impro ved user interface, UI functionality on mobile devices, Additional SQL tables, Report Generation 
capabilities, Scheduling and Reminders, Security features (MS Single sign -on), Deployment to Share Point 
Environment.  ### Assistant: Thank you for providing that information. Based on your requirements, here are the programming knowledge necessary to complete the project:  1. Ruby on Rails: The training matrix program is built using Ruby on Rails, so proficiency in this framework is essential. You'll need to know how to create routes, models, views, and controllers. 2. SQL: As the program involves interacting with databases, understanding SQL is crucial. You should be familiar with creating, modifying, and querying databases using SQL. 3. Mobile Devices: To improve the user interface and functionality on mobile devices, you'll need to have some experience with responsive design and mobile-specific development techniques. 4. Additional SQL Tables: Depending on the specific requirements of the project, you may need to create additional SQL tables to store data related to scheduling, reminders, or other features. 5. Report Generation: To generate reports based on the data stored in the database, you'll need to have some experience with report generation tools such as Rake or CoffeeScript. 6. Scheduling and Reminders: To implement scheduling and reminder features, you'll need to use a scheduling library or tool such as Calendars gem or Pusher Chat API. 7. Security Features: To integrate Microsoft Single Sign-On (SSO) security feature, you'll need to have some experience with OAuth authentication and authorization protocols. 8. Deployment to SharePoint Environment: To deploy the program to a SharePoint environment, you'll need to have some experience with SharePoint development and deployment processes. 9. Responsive Design: As the program will be accessed on various devices, having some experience with responsive design principles and techniques will help ensure a consistent user experience across different platforms. 10. Testing and Debugging: Finally, you'll need to have some experience with testing and debugging techniques to ensure the program functions correctly and is free of errors. Overall, a solid understanding of web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, experience with SQL and NoSQL databases, and familiarity with front-end development principles will be essential for completing this project successfully.
